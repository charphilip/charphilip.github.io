                <h3>Highlights from the past season</h3>

                <p>What an incredible season we have had. We celebrated our 50th year of running trips down the 
                Grand Canyon. This year we ran 36 trips down the Grand Canyon introducing over 800 people to 
                one of our favorite places on earth. We trained 4 new guides and welcomed them to our family. 
                The season started off with some chilly weather in the early season, but our guests braved the 
                cold and loved every minute of their trip (show pictures). Later the temperatures soared reaching 
                highs of 120 F in the Grand canyon and 95 on the Salmon. We didn't have any trouble getting people 
                in the water at those temperatures.</p>

                <h3>Encounters in the wild!</h3>
                <p>Our trips are all run in some of the most remote areas of the United States. We share these 
                areas with lots of critters both large and small. Here are some tips on what to do if you should 
                find yourself face to face with one.</p>
                <div>
                    <h4>Scorpions</h4>
                    <p>There are hundreds of varieties of scorpions, most of them being harmless. There are, 
                    however, a handful of them that can be dangerous and even potentially lethal. Scorpions can 
                    be found in almost every ecosystem and are very adaptable to their environment. The scorpion 
                    that calls Phantom Ranch in the Grand Canyon home is the Bark Scorpion, the most venomous in 
                    the United States. Do not worry though, the bark scorpions are only lethal to their prey and 
                    luckily humans are not on that list!</p>
                    <p>They spend the day hiding and crawl out at night to hunt. They will eat crickets, moths, 
                    spiders and other insects. Many compare their sting to an intense bee sting. Relief can be 
                    found with ice, aspirin and time.</p>
                    <p>When in the canyon, pay attention to where you are walking at night. Always wear your shoes 
                    or sandals. Always have a light with you to see where you are going. Never try to capture a 
                    scorpion and if you get stung, see your guide immediately.</p>
                    <h4>Big horn sheep</h4>
                    <p>For many people, bighorn sheep symbolize the rugged mountain west. It is one of two species 
                    of wild sheep in North America. It’s compact body is muscular with chocolate brown fur. Most 
                    weigh 160-250 lbs. They have exceptional vision, hearing and smell that helps them detect and 
                    avoid predators.</p>
                    <p>Their large curved horns can weigh up to 30 lbs. Females also have horns but they are short 
                    with a slight curvature. Horns are used as tools for eating and fighting.</p>
                    <p>If you encounter a big horn sheep, don’t agitate it. The park service asks that you stay 
                    100 feet away from big game animals. Leave them enough room for escape if they feel threatened.</p>
